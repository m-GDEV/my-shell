# my-shell

Very simple shell implementation.

I wrote this project quickly to just learn how shells work at a basic level.

Once I learned what exec and fork were it was pretty obvious what the basic model of
shells were.

I might add more features in the future but currently in **my-shell** you can:

-   run any command in your `$PATH`
-   use '.' as directories
-   exit with: exit, Exit, bye, or e
-   change directories with `cd`
-   enter empty command
-   report return code of commad

Planned features:

-   `time` (maybe)
-   aliases
